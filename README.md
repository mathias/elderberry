# elderberry

Elderberry is a small, simple HTTP server library for Node.js written in ClojureScript. It learns from [restify](http://mcavage.me/node-restify/) and @bodil's [dogfort](https://github.com/bodil/dogfort). It aims to require no additional node modules beyond what comes with ClojureScript, making it easier to include in ClojureScript projects.

This library is built with the excellent [boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) build tool.
